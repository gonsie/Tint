# Terminal in a Tab (Tint for short)

## Why?

First, I wanted to see if it could be done.  Then it started becoming useful.

## Caveats

 - no interactive commands (ie, no input from terminal)
 - piping should work just fine though (grep, etc.)
 - you can't change directories (yet)
 - doesn't work on Windows (currently)
